# Creating a Twitter Application

For getting live tweets in this course, we will connect to twitter through the so-called [Filter Stream API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview.html). 

This allows setting some filter options, which defines the Tweets we are interested in. Filters can be set on Terms, Geographic Location, Language and User. 

In order to use the Twitter [Filter Stream API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview.html), we have to apply for a Twitter developers account. 

## Apply for a Twitter developers account

If you don't have a Twitter user yet, you also have to create an account, which you can do from the sign in page below. It's free and you can for example use your school email address for it. 

Navigate to <https://developer.twitter.com/en> and click on the **Sign in** button on the top right corner.

After login in you should get forwarded to your Twitter account homepage. Navigate to <https://developer.twitter.com/en> to access the Twitter Developers portal as a signed-in user.
